# Lil Avenue 

A lil version of the game [Avenue](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/205045/avenue) that deals farm and road cards. You'll need your own [player sheets](http://aportagames.com/Avenue_PlayWithRahdo.pdf). Bootstrapped from the lovely [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Designed specifically for the dimensions of an iPad Mini, but use elsewhere at your own risk.

## Development

### To get things running locally:

1. Clone directory and install dependencies: `npm install`
